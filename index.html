                          <br>In this three-hour tour, you will learn more about the rich history of the Gothic Centre of Barcelona, which has developed enormously since the Roman period to become the thriving hub that it is today. &nbsp;
                          <br><br>
                          The&nbsp;<strong>Gothic Quarter</strong>&nbsp;- also known as Barri GÃ²tic, is the area that stretches from La Rambla to Via Laietana, and from the Mediterranean seafront to Ronda de Sant Pere and is the centre of the old city of Barcelona. It is known as the Gothic Quarter as it used to be the location of a Roman village and some of the remnants still remain. Currently, the Gothic Quarter is perhaps one of the most exciting part of the city as it's home to some of Barcelona's most famous landmarks, excellent restaurants, amazing restaurants and many squares (placas) to relax and unwind.&nbsp;</div></div>
